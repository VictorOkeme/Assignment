<summary>My Childhood</summary>
<p>I was born and raised in a small town in Lagos. My parents were both health workers, and i spent my childhood indoor.<br/>
I love spending time indoors, because it was nice and peaceful. I do play soccer and rode my bike at times.<br/>
I also love spending time with mu family. We would sometimes go out to eat, watch soccer games.</p>
